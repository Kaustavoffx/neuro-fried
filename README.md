# NEURO-FRIED: TEMPORAL COLLAPSE

> **"The future is broken. You have 60 seconds to fix it."**

## 🎮 Overview

**Neuro-Fried** is a high-octane cyberpunk trivia survival game. You play as a rogue archivist in a collapsing timeline, desperately trying to reorder history before the "Temporal Storm" erases existence.

**Goal:** Answer questions correctly to buy time. Survive as long as you can against accelerating time, glitches, and reality inversions.

## ✨ Features

*   **Temporal Mechanics:**
    *   **Freeze [SPACE]:** Pause the timeline for 5 seconds to think.
    *   **Rewind [R]:** Undo a mistake or gain time, but at a cost: **Every rewind accelerates the collapse.**
*   **Dynamic Difficulty:** As you play, the "Tick Rate" increases. The better you do, the faster the game becomes.
*   **Anomalies:** Random timeline corruptions including **Mirror Mode** (Inverted UI) and **Chrono-Acceleration** (2x Speed).
*   **Visuals:** CRT scanlines, chromatic aberration, VHS glitches, and a reactive particle system.
*   **Audio:** Self-hosted synthwave background music and generated sound effects.
