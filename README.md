# ⚡ NEURO-FRIED ⚡
### A Time-Survival Horror Experience

> *"You wake up. Your head is pounding. The clock reads 60 seconds... and it's counting down."*

## 🩸 THE STORY

You are trapped inside a **collapsing neural network**. Reality is fragmenting around you.

Your memories are bleeding away — fragments of history, technology, science... everything you once knew is slipping through your fingers like sand.

The only way to survive? **REMEMBER.**

Each correct answer buys you precious seconds. Each mistake? It costs you.

But here's the cruel twist: **Every time you rewind, the collapse accelerates faster.**

*Time is the only currency. And yours is running out.*

## 🎮 THREE FATES AWAIT

The machine doesn't let you choose. **It decides your fate.**

| Mode | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| 🎯 **OWN LUCK** | Standard survival. Freeze time. Rewind mistakes. Fight for every second. |
| 🌀 **TIME LOOP** | You die... and wake up again. Was it a dream? Reality glitches. The loop continues. |
| ⚔️ **TIMELINE DUEL** | Face yourself from another timeline. Day turns to night. Solve the final puzzle or be trapped forever. |

## ⏱️ CORE MECHANICS

```
60 SECONDS. THAT'S ALL YOU GET.

✅ Correct Answer  →  +5 seconds
❌ Wrong Answer    →  -5 seconds  
❄️ FREEZE [SPACE]  →  Pause time for 5 seconds
⏪ REWIND [R]      →  +20 seconds... BUT game speed increases FOREVER

Every 5 questions → Timer accelerates
Survive 20 questions → Neural Sync Complete
Timer hits zero → GAME OVER
```

## 🔥 WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

- **Time is your health bar** — No lives, no hearts. Just seconds bleeding away.
- **Risk vs Reward** — Rewind saves you now, but dooms you later.
- **Streak System** — Chain correct answers for score multipliers and power charges.
- **Anomaly Events** — Random chaos: Mirror Mode, Chrono-Acceleration, screen distortions.
- **Horror Atmosphere** — Blood-red ambience, screen shake, CRT effects, anxiety pulse.
- **3 Unique Game Modes** — Each playthrough is different.

## 🎰 THE LUCK SYSTEM

*"Your fate is not yours to choose. The machine decides."*

Before each game, spin the **Fate Roulette**:
- Three slots spin like a casino machine
- They slow down one by one
- Your destiny is revealed: OWN LUCK, TIME LOOP, or TIMELINE DUEL

No choice. No escape. Only fate.

## 🎯 THEME: "THE CHANGING OF TIME"

This game is built around **time manipulation**:

- ⏱️ Time as your only resource (health = seconds)
- ❄️ FREEZE time to pause the countdown
- ⏪ REWIND time to gain seconds (at a permanent cost)
- 🌀 TIME LOOPS where death resets reality
- 🌙 DAY/NIGHT cycles in Timeline Duel mode
- ⚡ Accelerating time as you progress

Every mechanic, every decision, every consequence revolves around **the changing of time**.
